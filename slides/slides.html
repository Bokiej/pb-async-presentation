            <p><b>@wire</b> is external asynhronous callback and while we are quering in connectedCallback or somewhere else we can't rely on <b>@wire</b> response.</p>

                <p>In <b>bulbsComponent</b> are imported two asynchronous callbacks. One is js mokup <b>lightBulb</b> Apex like callback which were been used before and getBulb for <b>@wire</b> which returns light bulb simple object.</p>
                <p>When bulbs-app runs it is easy to see that @wire and promises inside connectedCallback are execute separately.</p>

            <h2>@wire is independent from other callbacks</h2>
            <p><b>@wire</b> is external asynhronous callback and while we are quering in connectedCallback or somewhere else we can't rely on <b>@wire</b> response because we don't know when it will be resolved.</p>

            <h2>When to use @wire</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>when we get simple cached data</li>
                <li>when @wire attributes relays on single constantly changing value and must be refreshed. Then use '$valueName' string pattern.</li>
                <li>get Salesforce object common data like <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.reference_wire_adapters_object_info" target="blank">getObjectInfo</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>But seems like the last reason is most important.</p>
