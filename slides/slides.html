            <section data-auto-animate>
                <p>We can handle many Promises at the same time with below methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Promise.all()</b></li>
                    <li><b>Promise.allSettled()</b></li>
                    <li><b>Promise.race()</b></li>
                    <li><b>Promise.any()</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every method will be described in next sections.</p>
